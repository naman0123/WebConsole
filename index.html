            <p>Visual Studio, more specifically Visual Studio Code, is<br/> a text editor produced by Microsoft.<br/>
                 It's actually a misunderstanding that Visual Studio<br/> Code is a fully functional IDE. It's more like a light fancy text editor but with extensions which will you do coding.<br/>
                People also refer to it as the lighter version of the original <br/>"Visual Studio" which is an IDE used to code Interpreted languages like Python, Javascript etc. and Compiled languages such a C++, C# etc.<br/>
                To set up Visual Studio Code you can download it from there <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Website</a>.

            <p>Console is a screen where the output of all code being executing is printed.<br/> We use console for debugging and making sure if everything is being executed correctly.<br/>
                There are many ways to open console but the most common way is to <br/> open the "Debug Console" tab in VS Code, execute you're code and you will see the output of the code.<br/>
                To print anything on console use "console.log("You're output goes here")" for JavaScript and in the round brackets write your output.
